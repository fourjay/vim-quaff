# vim-quaff
Use (abuse) quickfix to keep file level notes

This is inspired by qfedit, QFV. CodeReview.vim and a serveral other editable QuickFix utilities.
Unlike those plugins, this does not attempt to facilitate search and replace.
For that use I'd recommend romainl ``qf.vim`` as a clean and vimlike version.
This plugin focuses on the simple use case of allowing ad-hoc quickfix lists.
